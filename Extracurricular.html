      <h3>Soccer Was Not a Dream — So What Is It?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>"Chikwese chiriko here nhasi?"</strong> ("Do we have a soccer game today?") — 
        that was our version of hello growing up. If the answer was “No,” it felt like 
        someone had stolen the sun. If it was “Yes!” — that was the golden ticket, 
        the day’s blessing, the reason to run faster than goats being chased from the garden.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started playing barefoot with balls made of plastic bags tied together. 
        The dusty roads, rocky hills, and Mr. Masimbi’s sugarcane-lined path became 
        our stadium. Every kick, every goal, every cheer felt like magic. 
        Soccer wasn’t just a game — it was freedom, joy, and our daily dose of hope.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “We called blackened toenails ‘football stripes’ — proof of dedication.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        With no referees, the ball owner’s word was law. After each match, 
        we ran to the river, washed off the dust, and headed home pretending 
        we hadn’t just played for hours. My grandparents never bought it.
      </p>

      <p>
        High school brought tournaments, trophies, and the nickname 
        <strong>Mashasha</strong> — “the best of everything.” 
        That name became our identity, spreading across schools like wildfire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, in the U.S., I still lace up. My motto remains: 
        <em>“Whether we win, lose, or draw — there must be my goal.”</em>
      </p>

      <h4>Dream Come True — Chelsea vs. Real Madrid</h4>
      <p>
        August 2024: I flew to North Carolina to watch Chelsea play Real Madrid. 
        The boy who once made footballs out of plastic bags now sat in a stadium, 
        cheering his heroes live. Yes, Chelsea lost — but for me, it was pure victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        From barefoot roads in Munjerenje to stadium lights in America — 
        my soccer journey is more than sport. It’s about resilience, 
        joy, and living the dream my <em>sekuru</em> always saw in me.
