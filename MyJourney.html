  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #530eca; margin-bottom: 20px;">My Journey: From Chipinge to Code</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
  My name is Blessing Addingtony Sithole, born in Mashiri, a rural village nestled in the Chipinge district of Manicaland, Zimbabwe. Growing up, access to quality education and technology was not a privilege we enjoyed—it was a dream we chased with dusty feet and hopeful hearts. Reflecting on my journey takes courage, because sometimes it brings tears to my eyes.
  But through it all, my grandparents became the unwavering light in the darkness. They planted in me a powerful seed of truth:
<strong>education and perseverance can change lives</strong>.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
    Even with overcrowded classrooms and minimal resources, I stayed focused. I studied by the dim light of a kerosene lamp, driven by the dream that one day, I could harness technology to create meaningful change—
    not just for myself, but for others in my community.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
    Today, I’m pursuing a double major degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Keene State College (KSC) in the United States. This opportunity has expanded my perspective and strengthened my commitment 
    to becoming an engineer who builds innovative, inclusive, and human-centered solutions.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
    My passion lies in solving real-world problems through code—particularly those affecting global industries and large-scale systems. 

  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
    Outside of academics, I lead as President of several student organizations. 
    These roles allow me to connect with people from all backgrounds, share my story, and empower others to pursue their goals—no matter where they start.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
    My journey from rural Zimbabwe to the U.S. is more than a change in geography—it’s a transformation of purpose. 
    I carry with me the hopes of my community and a vision to build software that matters. 
    My dream is to become a full-stack developer and a tech leader, building bridges through code and innovation—especially for those who are often overlooked.
  </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
  The transition was not easy. Moving across continents meant learning new systems, new cultures, and new expectations—often all at once. 
  There were moments of doubt, moments where I questioned whether I truly belonged in rooms filled with advanced technology and unfamiliar confidence.
  But each challenge strengthened my resilience and reminded me why I started.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
  Through coursework, research, and hands-on projects, I discovered that software is more than lines of code—it is a language of impact.
  Whether building web applications, analyzing systems, or designing solutions, I see technology as a tool for empowerment.
  A single well-designed system can create access, efficiency, and opportunity where none existed before.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
  My background keeps me grounded. I carry the lessons of scarcity, community, and perseverance into every project I work on.
  They remind me to design with empathy, to build responsibly, and to never forget the people behind the problems I aim to solve.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
  As I continue my journey in technology, my goal is not only to succeed—but to lift others as I rise.
  I want to mentor, to create opportunities, and to help shape a future where innovation reaches even the most remote corners of the world.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
  This is not just my story—it is a promise.
  A promise to my grandparents, to my community, and to every child studying under a dim light with big dreams.
  And this is only the beginning.
